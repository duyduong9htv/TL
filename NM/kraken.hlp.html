KRAKEN is the main program.  It takes an environmental file,
computes the modes, and writes them to disk for use by other
modules.  A print file is also produced, echoing the user
input.
</p><p>
KRAKENC is a complex arithmetic version (hence the C in KRAKENC)
of KRAKEN.  By working in the complex domain, loss mechanisms
such as ice scatter and material absorption may be included
'exactly' rather than perturbatively.  In addition, leaky modes
may be computed.  The price of this non-perturbative treatment is
a slowdown in speed by approximately a factor of 4.  This factor
principally represents the difference between complex and real
arithmetic.
</p><p>
A further slow down by a factor of 2 or more may
occur it the Twersky scatter option is used in KRAKENC. The
calculation of the Twersky scatter function can require
significant CPU time; enough to actually be a dominant part of
the cost of computing the modes. KRAKEN incorporates the scatter
perturbatively and is much less sensitive to the cost of Twersky
scatter.
</p><p>
KRAKEN does not at allow for losses in elastic media due
to material attenuation.  Thus, for attenuating elastic media,
KRAKENC should be used.

DESCRIPTION OF INPUTS:


(1) - TITLE
 
      Syntax:
         TITLE
      Description:
         TITLE: Title of run enclosed in sinqle quotes.


(2) - FREQUENCY

      Syntax:
         FREQ
      Description:
         FREQ: Frequency in Hz.


(3) - NUMBER OF MEDIA

      Syntax:
         NMEDIA (&lt;20)
      Description:
         NMEDIA: Number of media.

      The problem is divided into media within which it is
      assumed that the material properties vary smoothly. A new
      medium should be used at fluid/elastic interfaces or at
      interfaces where the density changes discontinuously. The
      number of media in the problem is defined excluding the
      upper and lower half-space. 


(4) - OPTIONS

      Syntax:
         OPTION
      Description:
         OPT(1:1): Type of interpolation to be used for the SSP.
                   'C' for C-linear,
                   'N' for N2-linear (n the index of refraction),
                   'S' for cubic Spline,
                   'A' for Analytic.  The user must modify the
                       analytic formulas in PROFIL.FOR then
                       compile and link. 

             If your not sure which option to take, I'd suggest
             you use 'C' or 'N'.  Practically, you can pick
             either one: the choice has been implemented to
             facilitate precise intermodel comparisons.

             Option 'S' is a little dangerous because splines
             yield a poor fit to certain kinds of curves,
             e.g. curves with sharp bends.  If you insist
             on splines, you can fix a bad fit by dividing the
             water column into two 'media' at the bend.

             Run PLOTSSP to check that the SSP looks the way you
             thought it should. Apart from potential typos,
             this will also show up fit-problems.

         OPT(2:2): Type of top boundary condition.
                   'V' VACUUM above top.
                   'A' ACOUSTO-ELASTIC half-space.
                       Requires another line as described in
                       block (4a). 
                   'R' Perfectly RIGID.
                   'F' Reflection coefficient from a FILE
                       (available in KRAKENC only). Requires
                       additional lines as described in
                       block (4c).
                   'S' for Soft-boss Twersky scatter.
                   'H' for Hard-boss Twersky scatter.
                   'T' for Soft-boss Twersky scatter, amplitude
                       only.
                   'I' for Hard-boss Twersky scatter, amplitude
                       only. The Twersky scatter options require
                       another line as described in block
                       (4c). Mnemonically, T, I options are one
                       letter after S, H in the alphabet. Current
                       wisdom is that option T is most
                       appropriate for ice scatter.

                    For open ocean problems option 'V' should be
                    used for the top BC.  The Twersky options
                    are intended for under-ice modeling.

         OPT(3:3): Attenuation units.
                   'N' Nepers/m.
                   'F' dB/(kmHz)       (F as in Freq. dependent)
                   'M' dB/m            (M as in per Meter)
                   'W' dB/wavelength   (W as in per Wavelength)
                   'Q' quality factor.
                   'T' Thorp attenuation formula.  This overrides
                       any other attenuations specified.

                   KRAKEN ignores material attenuation
                   in elastic media. (KRAKENC treats
                   it properly).

         OPT(4:4): Slow/robust root-finder.
                   '.' As in: I want all the modes and I don't
                       care how long it takes. Period.
                       (Available in KRAKENC only.)
                       In certain problems with elastic layers
                       the old root-finder has been known to
                       skip modes.
                       

(4a) - TOP HALFSPACE PROPERTIES

      Syntax:
         ZT  CPT  CST  RHOT  APT  AST
      Description:
         ZT:   Depth (m).
         CPT:  Top P-wave speed (m/s).
         CST:  Top S-wave speed (m/s).
         RHOT: Top density (g/cm3).
         APT:  Top P-wave attenuation. (units as given in Block 2)
         AST:  Top S-wave attenuation. (  "   "    "    "   "   ")

         This line should only be included if OPT(2:2)='A', i.e.
         if the user has specified a homogeneous halfspace for
         the top BC.


(4b) - TOP REFLECTION COEFFICIENT

      Syntax: 
         NTHETA
         THETA(1)       RMAG(1)       RPHASE(1)
         THETA(2)       RMAG(2)       RPHASE(2)
           .
           .
           .
         THETA(NTHETA)  RMAG(NTHETA)  RPHASE(NTHETA)

      Description:
         NTHETA:   Number of angles.
         THETA():  Angle.
         RMAG():   Magnitude of reflection coefficient.
         RPHASE(): Phase of reflection coefficient (degrees).

      Example:
         3
         0.0   1.00  180.0
         45.0  0.95  175.0
         90.0  0.90  170.0

      These lines should be contained in a separate '.TRC' file.
      This file is only required if OPT(2:2)='F', i.e. if the
      user has specified that the top BC is read from a '.TRC'
      (Top Reflection Coefficient) file. 

      This option for tabulated reflection coefficients is
      somewhat experimental at this time. I haven't worried about
      the multivalued character of the phase function: choose
      your reference and make sure the phase varies continuously.
      A complicated reflection coefficient may well cause
      problems for the mode-finder. 


(4c) - TWERSKY SCATTER PARAMETERS

      Syntax:
         BUMDEN  ETA  XI
      Description:
         BUMDEN: Bump density (ridges/km).
         ETA:    Principal radius 1 (m).
         XI:     Principal radius 2 (m).

      This line should only be included when one of the
      Twersky-scatter options is selected. 

(5) - MEDIUM INFO

      Syntax:
         NMESH  SIGMA  Z(NSSP)
      Description:
         NMESH:   Number of mesh points to use initially.
                  The number of mesh points should be about 10
                  per vertical wavelength in acoustic media. In
                  elastic media, the number needed can vary quite
                  a bit; 20 per wavelength is a reasonable
                  starting point.

                  The maximum allowable number of mesh points is
                  given by 'MAXN' in the dimension statements. 
                  At present 'MAXN' is 50000.  The number of mesh
                  points used depends on the initial mesh and the
                  number of times it is refined (doubled).  The
                  number of mesh doublings can vary from 1 to 5
                  depending on the parameter RMAX described
                  below.

                  If you type 0 for the number of mesh points,
                  the code will calculated NMESH automatically.

         SIGMA:   RMS roughness at the interface.

         Z(NSSP): Depth at bottom of medium (m).
                  This value is used to detect the last SSP point
                  when reading in the profile that follows. 

(5a) - SOUND SPEED PROFILE

      Syntax:
         Z(1)     CP(1)     CS(1)     RHO(1)     AP(1)     AS(1)
         Z(2)     CP(2)     CS(2)     RHO(2)     AP(2)     AS(2)
          .
          .
          .
         Z(NSSP)  CP(NSSP)  CS(NSSP)  RHO(NSSP)  AP(NSSP)  AS(NSSP)
      Description:
         Z():     Depth (m).
                  The surface starts at the first depth point
                  specified. Thus if you have say, XBT data which
                  starts at 50 m below the surface, then you'll
                  need to put in some SSP point at 0 m, otherwise
                  the free-surface would be placed at 50 m giving
                  erroneous results. The points Z(1) and Z(NSSP)
                  MUST correspond to the depths of interfaces
                  between media.

         CP():    P-wave speed (m/s).
         CS():    S-wave speed (m/s).
         RHO():   Density (g/cm3).
                  Density variations within an acoustic medium
                  are at present ignored.
         AP():    P-wave attenuation (units as given in Block 2)
         AS():    S-wave attenuation (  "   "    "    "   "   ")


       These lines should be omitted when the 'A' option is used
       (indicating that an analytic profile is supplied by a user
       written subroutine). 
  
       The '/' character signals that the remaining data on the
       line is the same as in the previous line of SSP data. For
       the very first line the default or 'previous' line is: 

          0.0 1500.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0

       This block should be repeated for each subsequent medium.


(6) - BOTTOM BOUNDARY CONDITION

      Syntax:
         BOTOPT  SIGMA
      Description:
         BOTOPT: Type of bottom boundary condition.
                 'V' VACUUM below bottom.
                 'A' ACOUSTO-ELASTIC half-space.
                     Requires another line with the half-space
                     parameters.  The format is the same as that
                     used for specifying the top halfspace BC. 
                 'R' Perfectly RIGID.
                 'F' reflection coefficient from a FILE (available
                     in KRAKENC only). Requires a Bottom
                     Reflection Coefficient file with
                     extension '.BRC'.  The format is the same as
                     that used for a Top Reflection coefficient.
                 'P' Precaculated internal reflection coefficient
                     from a FILE (available in KRAKENC only).
                     These files are generated using BOUNCE.
                 Option 'A' is generally used for ocean bottom
                 modeling.
         SIGMA:  Interfacial roughness (m).


(7) - PHASE SPEED LIMITS

      Syntax:
         CLOW  CHIGH
      Description:
         CLOW:   Lower phase speed limit (m/s).
                 CLOW will be computed automatically if you set
                 it to zero. However, by using a nonzero CLOW you
                 can skip the computation of slower modes. Mainly
                 this is used to exclude interfacial modes (e.g.
                 a Scholte wave).  The root finder is especially
                 slow in converging to these interfacial
                 modes and when the source and receiver are
                 sufficiently are far from the interface the
                 interfacial modes are negligible.

         CHIGH:  Upper phase speed limit (m/s).
                 The larger CHIGH is, the more modes are
                 calculated and the longer the execution time.
                 Therefore CHIGH should be set as small as
                 possible to minimize execution time.

                 On the other hand, CHIGH controls the maximum
                 ray angle included in a subsequent field
                 calculation-- ray paths are included which turn
                 at the depth corresponding to CHIGH in the SSP.
                 Thus a larger CHIGH means more deeply
                 penetrating rays are included.

                 Choice of CHIGH then becomes a matter of
                 experience.  In the far-field and at
                 high-frequencies, rays travelling in the ocean
                 bottom are severely attenuated and one may set
                 CHIGH to the sound speed at the ocean bottom. In
                 the near-field, low-frequency case, rays
                 refracted in the bottom may contribute
                 significantly to the field and CHIGH should be
                 chosen to include such ray paths.

                 KRAKEN will (if necessary) reduce CHIGH so that
                 only trapped (non-leaky) modes are computed. 

                 KRAKENC will attempt to compute leaky modes if
                 CHIGH exceeds the phase velocity of either the
                 S-wave or P-wave speed in the half-space. Leaky
                 mode computations are somewhat experimental at
                 this time. 


(8) - MAXIMUM RANGE

      Syntax:
         RMAX
      Description:
         RMAX:   Maximum range (km).
                 This parameter should be set to the largest
                 range for which a field calculation will be
                 desired.

                 During the mode calculation the mesh is doubled
                 successively until the eigenvalues are
                 sufficiently accurate at this range. If you set
                 it to zero, then no mesh doublings will be
                 performed. You don't need to worry too much
                 about this parameter-- even if you set it to
                 zero the results will usually be reasonable.

(9) - SOURCE/RECEIVER DEPTH INFO

      Syntax:
         NSD  SD(1:NSD)
         NRD  RD(1:NRD)
      Description:
         NSD:  The number of source   depths.
         SD(): The source   depths (m).
         NRD:  The number of receiver depths.
         RD(): The receiver depths (m).

         This data is read in using list-directed I/O so you can
         type it just about any way you want, e.g. on one line or
         split onto several lines.  Also if your depths are
         equally spaced then you can type just the first and last
         depths followed by a '/' and the intermediate depths
         will be generated automatically. 

         CPU time is essentially independent of the number of
         sources and receivers so that you can freely ask for up
         to 4095 depths. However, for high-frequencies the
         storage for the mode files can be excessive. 

         The source/rcvr depths are sorted and merged and then the
         modes are calculated at the union of the two sets
         of depths. Thus, it doesn't matter if you mix up source
         and receiver depths. Furthermore, you can leave out
         either the source or receiver specification (but not
         both simultaneously) simply by using a '/' for that
         line. 

         Sources and receivers cannot be placed in a half-space.

         If you are going to be doing a coupled-mode calculation
         then you must specify a large number of receiver depths
         spanning the entire column (down to the half-space).
         Fine sampling (about 10 points/wavelenght) is needed
         to calculate the coupling integrals accurately.

If the program aborts in some way, examine the print file which
is produced. Frequently an expected line has been omitted and the
environmental file is therefore misinterpreted.
</p><p>
The message "FAILURE TO CONVERGE IN SECANT" occurs when KRAKEN
requires more than 500 iterations to converge to a mode.  Usually
less than 20 iterations are needed but convergence to interfacial
modes (Scholte or Stoneley waves) can be exceptionally slow,
especially at higher frequencies. The simplest solution is to
exclude interfacial modes by setting the lower phase-speed limit
to the minimum p-wave speed in the problem.  Alternately, you can
increase the value of MAXNIT which controls the MAXimum Number of
ITerations in the root finder.
